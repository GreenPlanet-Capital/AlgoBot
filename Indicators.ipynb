    "* (Subject to change) Lookback period may be around 25 periods\n",
    "* All trend signals and reversal signals have to be mapped between the values of 0 and 10000, which will be used to build a cumulative scale. \n",
    "* The few securities under the scanned securities, which may show high vales on the cumulative scale, will be used to make a temporary concentrated portfolio for the chosen time interval\n",
    "* Oscillator Design: A difference between the values of one indicator from another, or the difference between the value of the indicator and its moving average\n",
    "* For those indicators and oscillators that are not range bound, reversal (overbought and oversold) signals may be generated by scanning if some higher percentage (like 90%) of the indicator values stay below a certain line. This line may be self adjusting, and such indicators may hold a larger weight, due to continous supervised machine learning.\n",
    "* Transaction cost models may be built into backtests.\n",
    "* Ex-Dividend Dates and Stock Splits will have to be adjusted into the model.\n",
    "* General Long bias, due to short-side premuims involved, but not a highly skewed bias\n",
    "* Heuristic: All method definitions must start with small letters\n",
    "* Define Absolute and trailing stops, taking into account transaction costs\n",
    "* Add output parameters while coding each indicator\n",
    "* In some cases, today and yesterday may also be used in the context of the period before, and the present period. Similar contexts may be used for other time periods \n",
    "* Higher weightage is given to those indicators having *useful* in the notes section.\n",
    "* Each of the functions(indicators) has to be backtested on upward biased, downward biased and range bound markets, and a test data set (sanity test)\n",
    "* The indicators have to be sorted into reversal indicators, trend indicators, strength indicators, and index indicators. \n",
    "* A lot of them have to be individually trained on a single security, and so we have to make it a consistently self training model. (So that we can just expose to prices of a single security, and it trains itself after a while, after which it's subjected to live trading)\n",
    "* Some of the reversal indicators have a short term bias, hence the need for a lookback training period"

    "# Volume\n",
    "\n",
    "**Usage:**\n",
    "1. **Trend Confirmation:**\n",
    "A rising market should see rising volume. Buyers require increasing numbers and increasing enthusiasm in order to keep pushing prices higher. Increasing price and decreasing volume might suggest a lack of interest, and this is a warning of a potential reversal. This can be hard to wrap your mind around, but the simple fact is that a price drop (or rise) on little volume is not a strong signal. A price drop (or rise) on large volume is a stronger signal that something in the stock has fundamentally changed.\n",
    "2. **Exhaustion Moves and Volume:**\n",
    "In a rising or falling market, we can see exhaustion moves. These are generally sharp moves in price combined with a sharp increase in volume, which signals the potential end of a trend. Participants who waited and are afraid of missing more of the move pile in at market tops, exhausting the number of buyers. At a market bottom, falling prices eventually force out large numbers of traders, resulting in volatility and increased volume. We will see a decrease in volume after the spike in these situations, but how volume continues to play out over the next days, weeks, and months can be analyzed using the other volume guidelines.\n",
    "3. **Bullish Signs:**\n",
    "Volume can be useful in identifying bullish signs. For example, imagine volume increases on a price decline and then the price moves higher, followed by a move back lower. If the price on the move back lower doesn't fall below the previous low, and volume is diminished on the second decline, then this is usually interpreted as a bullish sign.\n",
    "4. **Volume and Price Reversals:** \n",
    "After a long price move higher or lower, if the price begins to range with little price movement and heavy volume, this might indicate that a reversal is underway, and prices will change direction.\n",
    "5. **Volume and Breakouts vs. False Breakouts:**\n",
    "On the initial breakout from a range or other chart pattern, a rise in volume indicates strength in the move. Little change in volume or declining volume on a breakout indicates a lack of interest and a higher probability for a false breakout. \n",
